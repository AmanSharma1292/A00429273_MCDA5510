About Me:
Hi, I'm from India & so far liking Halifax & it's weather (my cooking not so much).
I'm a fresher but I did worked as an intern with Tata Consultancy Services as a developer & my role there was to help implement Internationalization i.e., multiple language support on one og the government site which I completed succesfully using Spring MVC.
Later, before coming here for my course in SMU I worked as a Quality Assurance Specialist (fancy term for a Software Tester) with Droom Technologies (for 3 months as a Trainee) & my area of focus there was mostly Quicksell/Auction of vehicles. 

Technology Familiarity: Core Java, HTML, .NET & SQL.

Expectation from Course: I'm really looking forward to enhance my skills in development & gain better understanding of how to optemize my code. Other than that I would really appreciate if we can discuss more about current technologies that are used in industries and some workshop on them as well.

Also, if possible if you can provide hard copies of notes then that would be really great.
